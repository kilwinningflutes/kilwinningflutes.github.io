                        <p>On Saturday 8th December, we played an evening concert in Beith Trinity Church, organised by and in aid of Beith Cultural &amp; Heritage Society. We&#8217;ve given concerts for BCHS on previous occasions and, as usual, there was a great turn-out.</p>
                        <p>We played a varied programme of classical music, marches, and popular music, and also had space for a couple of solos. Pieces included Gabriel&#8217;s Oboe, Pirates of the Caribbean, With Each Sunset, Jamie&#8217;s Patrol, and excerpts from Don Giovanni. Our soloists were Adam Smith, who played Mozart&#8217;s Rondo Alla Turca on xylophone, accompanied by the band; James McHugh, who played Debussy&#8217;s Syrinx; and Caitlin Turner, who played Doppler&#8217;s Hungarian Fantasy.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to BCHS for inviting us!</p>

                        <p>Yesterday, we competed at the SAFBA contest in Carluke. For the hymntune class, we played &#8216;With Each Sunset&#8217;, and the test piece was Mendelssohn&#8217;s Italian Symphony (Movts. I, II, and IV). We gained second place for the hymntune and third place for the test piece. Well done to all of our members, and also to the other bands!</p>

We played a varied programme of Don Giovanni, With Each Sunset, and Klezmer Karnival, with the march being Eagle Squadron. The band did very well, gaining third prize for the march and third prize overall. We are absolutely thrilled with the results, and would like to thank all our members for their efforts.</p>

                        <p>The band&#8217;s annual spring concert was held on 30th March in Kilwinning&#8217;s Erskine Church Hall. The turn-out this year was excellent, and we thank our supporters who so eagerly come to see us play. This year, we decided to do something a little different: as well as the music performed solely by flautists and percussionists, we played two pieces in which the band accompanied another musician. These pieces were &#8216;Dark Island&#8217;, with John Montgomery on accordion, and an arrangement of &#8216;Auld Lang Syne&#8217;, with Caitlin Turner on voice. These were well received by the audience, and it is likely that the band will attempt something similar in the near future.<br />
                           We also had guests in the form of local children who recited poetry for us, and a very talented young guitarist.<br />
                           Many thanks go to these guest artists, Kilwinning Burns Club for supporting us so strongly, and to Elaine Young for organising the buffet.

                        <p>On Saturday 5th, the band held a masterclass in its hall for young and aspiring flautists. There was a great turn-out this year, with many keen players from local schools and the band coming along to play. Feedback came from William Young (KAPFB&#8217;s conductor), John Bryce (conductor of Carluke Primrose), and Laura McBride (KAPFB member, who recently finished her degree in music): thank you to all of them.</p>
                        <p>Playing by all participants was of a very high standard, and constructive comments were given to all. We hope that the comments and encouragement prove useful to them, and that those who had never done so before enjoyed the experience of playing in public.</p>

                        <p>The band purchased its first contrabass flute recently, and we&#8217;re now excited to see it finally arrive and appear in our rehearsals. We are thrilled to have such an instrument in our group, as it will provide us with a depth of pitch which we have previously been unable to achieve. We know that it will be a very important section of our ensemble, and hope that our audiences will be impressed by the new sounds which we will be able to create.<br />
                           This is a huge achievement for us, as we have been saving up for more than three years for this instrument. Many thanks to all our supporters and members who have helped us raise the funds for it!
